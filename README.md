### AI-Powered Resume Screening & Hackathon Evaluation System

ResumeIQ is an intelligent AI-based automation platform designed to analyze resumes, extract structured candidate information, compare it with job descriptions or hackathon requirements, and predict selection and winning probability. The system enhances fairness, efficiency, and decision-making in recruitment and competitive events.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Traditional resume screening and hackathon shortlisting processes are manual, time-consuming, and often biased. Recruiters and organizers struggle to evaluate large volumes of resumes efficiently, while students lack clear feedback on why they were shortlisted or rejected. There is a need for an intelligent, scalable, and transparent system that can automate evaluation and provide actionable insights.
